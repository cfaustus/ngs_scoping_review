This repository contains scripts for processing and analysis of data gathered for a scoping review on genome sequencing applied to One Health and is associated with the manuscript "Pathogen genomics and One Health: a scoping review of current practices in zoonotic disease research"

The full dataset is available through the University of Glasgow Enlighten repository (https://doi.org/10.5525/gla.researchdata.1534) and a copy of the articles after full-text screening is in the data folder here.

There are two main parts of the code:

1. Data exploration and plotting of included full-text screened articles: Two scripts process and plot figures ('data_exploration.Rmd' & 'figures_for_publication.R'). Publication and extra figures are in the 'figures' subfolder.

2. Analysis of sample sizes across domains and within domains ('sample_size_glms.R').
